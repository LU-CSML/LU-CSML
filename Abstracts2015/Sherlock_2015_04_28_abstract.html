<h2>Delayed acceptance particle marginal random walk Metropolis algorithms
and their optimisation</h2>

Delayed-acceptance Metropolis-Hastings (DA-MH) and delayed-acceptance
pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings (DA-PsMMH) algorithms can be applied
when it is computationally expensive to calculate the true posterior or
an unbiased stochastic approximation thereof, but a computationally
cheap deterministic approximation is available. An initial accept-reject
stage uses the cheap approximation for computing the Metropolis-Hastings
ratio; proposals which are accepted at this stage are then subjected to
a further accept-reject step which corrects for the error in the
approximation. Since the expensive posterior, or the approximation
thereof, is only evaluated for proposals which are accepted at the first
stage, the cost of the algorithm is reduced.

We focus on the random
walk Metropolis (RWM) and consider the DA-PsMRWM, of which the DA-RWM is
a special case. Justified by a limiting diffusion argument, we develop
theoretical expressions for limiting efficiency and acceptance rates in
high dimension which inform a practical strategy for algorithm tuning. A
simulation study verifies a number of heuristic properties suggested by
our theory. For the example considered, our optimised DA-PsMRWM
algorithm is nearly an order of magnitude more efficient than the
equivalent optimised PsMRWM algorithm.
