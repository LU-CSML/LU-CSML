<h2>Bayesian Inference for Big Data: Current and Future Directions</h2>

Computational advances, such as MCMC, have made Bayesian statistics widely applicable to the modelling of complex systems. In the past, the aim has been to accurately estimate model parameters, often with little data made available. The challenge now is, how can we perform efficient inference with an abundance of data?  A range of approaches appearing recently in the literature have proposed to tackle this problem in a variety of ways. For example, data subsampling, compressed sensing, parallelisation, etc. where inference is performed using both exact and approximate methods. However, as of yet, there is no unified consensus on the best approach to take.

In the session I will give a brief review of some of the current approaches appearing in the literature and open up the session to a general discussion on current research and where future developments are needed.
