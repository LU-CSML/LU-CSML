<h2>Asymptotic Analysis of Random-Walk Metropolis on Ridged Densities</h2>

The asymptotic behaviour of local-move MCMC algorithms in high-dimensions is by now well understood and the  emergence of diffusion processes as trajectory limits has been proved in many such contexts. The results obtained so far involve mainly i.i.d scenarios, though there are now a number of generalizations in high/infinite dimensions. We adopt a different point of view and look at cases when the target distributions tend to exhibit `ridges' along directions of the state space. Such contexts could arise for instance in classes of models when data arrive with small noises or when there are non-identifiable subsets of  parameters.  In an asymptotic context all probability mass will concentrate on a manifold. We show that diffusion limits (on a manifold) abound also in this set-up of ridged densities and are particularly useful for identifying computational costs or providing optimality criteria.
