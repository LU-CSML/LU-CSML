<h2>Differentially Private Policy Evaluation</h2>



Differential privacy is a mathematical model of privacy which has recently gained a lot of attention within the machine learning community. Essentially, an algorithm operating on a database is differentially private if its output only reveals a small amount of information about any entity in the database. It can be shown that this provides a notion of privacy which is robust against attackers with side knowledge. The first part of this talk will review the basics of differential privacy. In the second part we will present our recent work on differentially private algorithms for policy evaluation in Markov decision processes. Policy evaluation is an important part of reinforcement learning algorithms. In the batch setting, Monte Carlo algorithms for policy evaluation can be formalized using a least squares regression problem with correlated data. Following this approach, we will present two private algorithms for policy evaluation, explain their privacy and utility guarantees, and discuss empirical results on a simple problem that mimics typical applications of Markov decision processes to medical domains.
