<h2>An overview of Bayesian non-parametrics</h2>


An important problem in statistics is model selection. For example, how many components do I choose for my mixture model? Bayesian nonparametrics provide a way to use the data to determine model complexity automatically. In this talk I'll introduce Bayesian nonparametrics, with a particular focus on Dirichlet Processes, one of the most common priors used for this. We'll look at some procedures for inference in Dirichlet processes, and some attempts to make this scalable using variational inference.
