<h2>Pseudo-marginal MCMC using averages of unbiased estimators </h2>

We consider pseudo-marginal MCMC where the unbiased estimator of the posterior is constructed using an average of exchangeable unbiased estimators, and compare the
efficiency of a chain which uses the average of m estimators to that of a chain which uses just one of the estimators. Recent theory has shown that the chain that uses all m estimators mixes better than the chain that uses only one of them. We provide theoretical bounds on the improvement in mixing efficiency obtainable by averaging the m estimators and, motivated by this theory and by simulation studies, we discuss the translation to a choice of m for optimal computational efficiency.
