<h2>Improved Convergence of Regression Adjusted Approximate Bayesian Computation</h2>

We present a number of surprisingly strong asymptotic results for the regression-adjusted version of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) introduced by Beaumont et al. (2002). We show that for an appropriate choice of the bandwidth in ABC, using regression-adjustment will lead to an ABC posterior that, asymptotically, correctly quantifies uncertainty. Further- more, for such a choice of bandwidth we can implement an importance sampling algorithm to sample from the ABC posterior whose acceptance probability tends to 1 as we increase the data sample size. This compares favorably to results for standard ABC, where the only way to obtain an ABC posterior that correctly quantifies uncertainty is to choose a much smaller bandwidth, for which the acceptance probability tends to 0 and hence for which Monte Carlo error will dominate.
