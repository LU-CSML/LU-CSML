<h2>Continuous-Time Importance Sampling (and MCMC)</h2>

We will introduce a new framework for sequential Monte Carlo, based on evolving a set of weighted particles in continuous time. This framework can lead to novel versions of existing algorithms, such as Annealed Importance Sampling and the Exact Algorithm for diffusions, and can be used as an alternative to MALA for sampling from a target distribution of interest. These methods are amenable to the use of sub-sampling, which can greatly increase their computational efficiency for big-data applications; and can enable unbiased sampling from a much wider-range of target distributions than existing approaches.
