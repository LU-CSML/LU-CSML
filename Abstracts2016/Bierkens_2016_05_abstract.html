<h2>Super-efficient sampling using Zig Zag Monte Carlo</h2>


In recent work (Bierkens, Roberts 2015, http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00302) we stumbled upon an elementary piecewise deterministic Markov process ("zig zag process") which can be extended to have a general (absolutely continuous) invariant probability distribution in R^n. We develop MCMC based on the zig zag process. The 
sample paths of the zig zag process can be efficiently simulated by rejection sampling of the switching times. It is possible to perform 
exact sub-sampling with the zig zag process, which makes this sampling method extremely promising for applications in big data and/or complex 
models. Somewhat mysteriously, using this method we can achieve a higher efficiency than independent draws from the correct distribution would allow!
