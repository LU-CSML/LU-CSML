<h2>Online inference and model selection using sequential Monte Carlo</h2>


Motor unit number estimation (MUNE) has traditionally been used to
measure the degeneration of the motor system upon the onset of rare
incurable degenerative diseases such as Motor Neurone Disease.
Recently researchers at the Miami Institute for the cure of paralysis
have found another application for MUNE  in the assessment of stem cell
therapies for spinal regeneration.  An objective  biologically plausible
method for estimation of the extent of regeneration of the nervous
system is required.  The initial model of Ridall et al., 2007 used a
highly computer intensive method called reversible jump MCMC  to carry
out model selection using assumptions which were thought to be
biologically plausible,  RJMCMC, however,  has limitations and fails
when the dimension of the model is high.  Recently we have been working
on an online technique for estimation and model selection using
sequential Monte Carlo. We look on our model as a state space model
where conditional on the states, both the observation and state
equations are completely tractable.  This enables efficient recursions
for online estimation.
In this talk I will introduce the model of Ridall et al, 2007, the
modifications that are needed to carry out online inference and model
selection,  and finally speculate on other applications where this
technique may be useful and appropriate.
