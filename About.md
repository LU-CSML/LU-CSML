Lancaster University Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (LU CSML) is a friendly group of academics at Lancaster University. We usually meet weekly at 3pm Thursday and alternate between discussing each other's research and [recent papers](https://lu-csml.github.io/Discussion_Papers). The group host [talks](https://lu-csml.github.io/Talks) that have been given by both our members and external guests.

If you would like to be added to the mailing list, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](https://lu-csml.github.io/Contact).
