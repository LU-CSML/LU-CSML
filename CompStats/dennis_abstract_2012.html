<h2>Summary statistics for ABC model choice </h2>

Recently there has been much interest in using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods for model choice.  However, concerns have been raised that the results are often not robust to summary statistic choice.  We propose a method of choosing useful summary statistics, extending the idea of semi-automatic ABC (Fearnhead and Prangle 2012). The method is illustrated by a substantive application in population genetics; detecting demographic change in a bacterial population.
