<h2>Filtering, drift homotopy and target tracking</h2>

Target tracking is a problem of paramount importance arising in Biology, Defense, Ecology and other scientific fields. We attack to this problem by employing particle filtering. Particle filtering is an importance sampling method which may fail in several occasions, e.g. in high dimensional data. In this talk, we present a novel approach for improving particle filters suited to target tracking with a nonlinear observation model. The suggested approach is based on what I will call drift homotopy for stochastic differential equations which describe the dynamics of the moving target. Based on drift homotopy, we design a Markov Chain Monte Carlo step which is appended to the particle filter and aims to bring the particles closer to the observations while at the same time respecting the dynamics. The talk is based on joint works with Kai Kang and Panos Stinis.
