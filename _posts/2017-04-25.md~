title: Bayes Comp 2018
---

This week we'll be looking at the recently arXived "Discontinuous Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for sampling discrete parameters" [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08510) by Nishimura et al.

[Bayes Comp 2018](https://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/personal/tk/bayescomp/) is a biannual conference sponsored by the ISBA section 
of the same name. The conference and the section both aim to promote 
original research into computational methods for inference and decision 
making and to encourage the use of frontier computational tools among 
practitioners, the development of adapted software, languages, 
platforms, and dedicated machines, and to translate and disseminate 
methods developed in other disciplines among statisticians.

Bayes Comp 2018 is current incarnation of the popular MCMSki series of
conferences.
